| December 6th  |  5:30-6:10 pm  | Lost my original work log due to git issues (my commits weren’t syncing properly), so I spent this block reconstructing everything I had completed so far. Reviewed the TextCompressor problem set again to make sure I didn’t miss anything important and re-documented my progress. This also helped me re-orient myself with the structure of the assignment and what still needed to be completed.  |
| December 8th  |  9:15-9:45 pm  |  Began working on the LZW compressor, starting with the compress() method. Got the TST initialization working with all ASCII characters and successfully set up the main prefix-finding loop. I confirmed that the prefix logic and dictionary-growth behavior matched the slides. Compression seemed correct, but I decided to leave thorough testing for later once expand() was implemented.                                                                                             |
| December 9th  |  6:15-6:45 pm  |   Worked on the expand() method and got the basic structure coded (initializing the dictionary array, reading the first code, and setting up the main decoding loop). Hit some confusion regarding the “lookahead code” and how to handle the classic LZW edge case where the next code has not yet been defined. Added comments and matched the structure to the pseudo-code from lecture.                                                                                            |
| December 9th  |  6:45-7:15 pm  |   Ran the first full compress→expand test and the output was completely corrupted. Traced it down to the fact that I was writing out strings using BinaryStdOut.write(String), which outputs 16-bit Unicode instead of 8-bit ASCII. Updated the write logic to output characters manually one byte at a time (as instructed in class). This fixed part of the issue, but the decoder still failed halfway through.                                                                                            |
| December 9th  |  7:15-7:45 pm  |     Ran my code again and the output was still off. Eventually realized I was overwriting entries in my dictionary during expansion, which is not supposed to happen in LZW. Once I removed that, things got a bit closer to correct, but the output still wasn’t fully matching. Went back to the notes to refresh myself on the edge case and make sure I wasn’t mixing up that part.                                                                                          |
| December 9th  |  7:45-8:15 pm  |                                                                                              Found the actual problem — the edge case when the next code hasn’t been added to the dictionary yet. My logic there was wrong. Fixed it so the new entry is formed from the current string plus its first character. After that, my smaller test files started expanding correctly. Still didn’t want to rely on that completely, so I tested a few more and made some small adjustments. |
| December 10th | 9:10 - 9:40 am |  Expansion finally seemed stable across multiple tests. Cleaned up a few comments and made sure the dictionary never grew past the limit. Also fixed the argument handling in main because I realized it wasn’t being checked properly. Everything was running without runtime errors by the end of this block                                                                                             |
| December 10th | 9:15 - 9:40 pm |  Did a final pass over the entire file, removed old debugging lines, and tightened up the comments. Verified compression ratios against the sample outputs and they matched what I expected. Made a final commit and checked that it actually pushed to git correctly                                                                                             |
